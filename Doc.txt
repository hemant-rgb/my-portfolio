ðŸ§© Packages & Tools Used
1. GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

GSAP is a powerful JavaScript animation library used to create smooth, high-performance animations for web elements and 3D scenes. In this project, GSAP is used to add scroll-triggered and timeline-based animations, bringing motion to text, sections, and 3D models. Its precision and control make the overall user experience more interactive and visually appealing.

Key Role:

Smooth transitions and reveal animations

Scroll-based interactions using ScrollTrigger

Performance-optimized motion for UI and 3D elements

2. Three.js (via React Three Fiber), Drei, and Postprocessing

Three.js is a 3D JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL.
React Three Fiber (R3F) is a React renderer for Three.js, allowing you to write 3D scenes using React components.
Drei provides helpful abstractions and prebuilt utilities (like OrbitControls, Environment, and useGLTF) that simplify working with 3D content.
Postprocessing adds cinematic effects such as bloom, depth of field, and color grading for enhanced visual realism.

Key Role:

Creating and rendering 3D models and environments

Simplifying 3D scene management with React-based syntax

Adding lighting, shadows, and visual effects

3. Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid UI development using pre-defined classes directly in JSX. It eliminates the need for writing traditional CSS by offering responsive, customizable utility classes.

Key Role:

Fast and responsive UI design

Clean, consistent styling directly in JSX

Perfect for maintaining a minimal yet modern aesthetic

4. GLB Model

A .glb file is a binary version of the glTF (GL Transmission Format) 3D model. It contains geometry, materials, textures, and animations in one compact file. These models are imported and rendered in React Three Fiber to display 3D objects on the website.

Key Role:

Efficient loading of 3D assets

Used for displaying interactive 3D objects in real-time

Compatible with R3F and optimized for web performance

5. react-responsive

react-responsive is a React library that enables conditional rendering based on screen size or device type. Itâ€™s used to ensure that the website looks great and functions properly on all devices â€” from desktops to mobile screens.

Key Role:

Handling responsive layouts in React

Enabling different UI behaviors on different devices

Improving mobile-friendliness and accessibility

6. gltfjsx (GLB â†’ JSX Converter)

gltfjsx is a CLI tool that converts .glb or .gltf 3D model files into reusable .jsx components. This makes it easier to integrate 3D assets directly into a React Three Fiber project.

Key Role:

Converts 3D models into React components

Optimizes 3D scene integration with clean JSX output

Simplifies model manipulation and animation in code

7. react-countup

react-countup is a lightweight React component used for animated number transitions, such as statistics or counters. It smoothly increases numbers from a start to an end value, enhancing the visual appeal of metrics or achievements displayed on the website.

Key Role:

Animated counters for numerical data

Smooth transitions for stats or milestones

Adds dynamic visual feedback for users

8. EmailJS

EmailJS enables sending emails directly from the frontend without requiring a backend server. It connects your contact forms to email services using templates and credentials managed securely in the EmailJS dashboard.

Key Role:

Sending emails from the websiteâ€™s contact form

No backend or server setup required

Secure and easy email integration
